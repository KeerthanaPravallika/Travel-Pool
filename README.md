# Travel-Pool

<h2>Description</h2>
We humans are social beings who find warmth and comfort in the people around us that we meet along the way. But unfortunately, the next person we need might be our friend or foe and with many of living away from home, our loved ones are always on the edge of their seats often losing the night’s sleep worrying about our well-being in an unknown territory fearing the worst and one thing that might help ease this sense of fear is knowing that we having someone with us for the journey. <br><br/>

The project “Travel Pool” is one step in that direction making everyone’s travel comfortable. The person has to Sign up/log in, after logging in they can view all the existing tickets(pools) which consist of time of travel, starting point, destination, their mode of transport, number of people (at maximum) they are willing to travel with etc.… If the person is interested to join any of the existing pools, they can access through the add to pool button and they can have a chat conversation through the website without the phone numbers being disclosed by us unless they do it explicitly. If the person is not willing to join any of the existing pools, they can create a new pool. And once the time elapsed the pool will be automatically closed.
